# Prepare VPC

## Terraform

- Install: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli
- Version
    ```
    terraform version
    Terraform v1.1.8
    on darwin_amd64
    + provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v4.11.0
    ```
- Module for VPC: https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/v3.14.0
## Steps

â€» Just for simplicity, here's using local tfstate `terraform.tfstate`.
### Create Resources

- VPC
- 6 Subnets (3 public & 3 private)
- Expected: `22 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.`

```
terraform init
terraform plan
```

terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
